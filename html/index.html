        <p>Most of the time you probably look at games as a waste of time, or many people do anyway. <br>
           They consume time that could be used for other things, like reading or spending time in the outdoors.<br>
           However, there are important things that you can get out of your time playing video games.</p>
           <p>Yes, if your video game playing is keeping you from caring for your kids, keeping your kids from doing their homework,<br>
              or it's affecting the cleanliness of your home, then it could be a bad thing.<br>
              But if you are monitoring your time, and your childrenâ€™s time, playing games, <br>
              you can all get something good out of that game play.</p>
