            <p>Most of the time you probably look at games as a waste of time, or many people do anyway. <br>
                They consume time that could be used for other things, like reading or spending time in the outdoors.<br>
                However, there are important things that you can get out of your time playing video games.</p>
                <p>Yes, if your video game playing is keeping you from caring for your kids, keeping your kids from doing their homework,<br>
                   or it's affecting the cleanliness of your home, then it could be a bad thing.<br>
                   But if you are monitoring your time, and your childrenâ€™s time, playing games, <br>
                   you can all get something good out of that game play.</p>

            <h3>BUILDS CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS</h3>
            <p>
                Whether you are playing games on a gaming console, on your computer,<br>
                or you are simply playing one of your favorite Android games on your smartphone or tablet,<br>
                you are developing your critical thinking skills. <br>
                You have to decide which door to open, what corridor to go down, and which zombies you have the time to stop and kills.
            </p>
            <p>
                These critical thinking skills can help you in the real world.<br>
                You'll learn more about fight or flight. <br>
                And, you'll even learn more about why it's sometimes important to think before you act, <br>
                and why sometimes you have to act because there is no time to think.

            <h3>INCREASES HAND-EYE COORDINATION</h3>
            <p>
                If you are playing games on a console using a wand or controller, <br>
                even using a wand while gaming on your computer, <br>
                you are developing your hand-eye coordination in an extreme way.<br>
                Even simply pushing letters and arrow buttons on a computer keyboard can help with hand-eye coordination though.

            <h3>DEVELOPS CREATIVITY</h3>
            <p>
                Video game creation is an art form. <br>
                That being said, like other forms of art, playing video games can inspire creativity. <br>
                While some might say that certain video games inspire people to treat women badly and that some of them may even inspire people to hurt others,<br>
                they too can inspire people to become artists, writers, movie producers, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even musicians and songwriters have been inspired to create songs because of their love for video games.<br> 
                Let your love of video games help inspire you. <br>
                Maybe it will turn you into a sketch artist, sculptor or painter. The sky’s the limit when it comes to individual creativity.

            <h3>IT'S FUN ! </h3>
            <p>
                The final reason why playing video games can be good for you is that they are simply fun.<br>
                They are entertaining, and they keep your mind working in a way that simply watching TV might not. <br>
                While video game playing is no replacement for reading a good book or enjoying the great outdoors, it isnâ€™t as bad for you as many would think.
